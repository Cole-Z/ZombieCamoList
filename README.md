# ZombieCamoList

Basic camo tracker for MW3 COD Zombies. Challenges and Levels are geared toward unlocking "Gold Enigma", which is the first step to unlocking the mastery camo grind.

All mastery camo challeges are the same for every weapon, so they are not documented in the app. The tracker reads from a text file, and updates a list box of every class of weapon. 
users can then click on a weapon to see the challenges, levels, and camos unclocked for each weapon. There is also a progress tracker that reads froma file and updates values based on
number of checkboxes, checked for each completed gun. Project is a great way to keep track of your progress locally, as this can be a very long process and the in-game
UI, is clunky and hard to keep track of in my opinion.
